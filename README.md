As you complete each lab, you should provide a description of your features and changes here.

## VR Lab: Lab 1

Well, I wanted to make it so that you grab some chickens scattered around the farm and put them back inside the coop. chickens are cute.


## VR Lab Completed:

The VRTK tutorial scene is called JumpStart, while the scene I made based on that is called ChickenTime.
Find and bring all 3 chickens back to the coop to win. There are snapzones in the coop for them, and text will pop up once all chickens
are returned. 

The initial prompt also disappears after a few seconds, which only took me one hour to figure out how to do! :^)

Also: Rumpelstiltskin
